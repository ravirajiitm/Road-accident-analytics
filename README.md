# Road Accident Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road accidents using data sourced from the Transport Department of Bihar. The primary objective is to forecast the best mode of transport to reduce the number of accidents. The analysis is conducted using Excel, and the insights are presented through dynamic dashboards.

## Data Source

The dataset is scraped from the Transport Department of Bihar and contains various parameters such as:

- Number of casualties
- Vehicle types
- Month-wise accident data
- Types of casualties (fatal, slight, serious)
- Area-wise casualties
- Casualties by lighting conditions
- Casualties by road surface

## Analysis and Insights

The Excel file includes detailed analysis and dynamic dashboards, providing insights into the following aspects:

1. **Monthly Casualties:**
   - Breakdown of casualties on a month-to-month basis.
   - Visualization of trends over time.

2. **Casualties by Vehicle Type:**
   - Analysis of casualties based on different types of vehicles.
   - Identification of vehicles contributing most to accidents.

3. **Fatal, Slight, and Serious Casualties:**
   - Categorization and analysis of casualties by severity.
   - Understanding the impact of accidents in terms of severity.

4. **Area-wise Casualties:**
   - Geographical distribution of accidents.
   - Identification of high-risk areas.

5. **Casualties by Lighting Conditions:**
   - Analysis of accidents based on lighting conditions (daylight, dark-light).
   - Insights into how lighting conditions affect accident rates.

6. **Casualties by Road Surface:**
   - Understanding the impact of road surface on accident severity.
   - Recommendations for improving road conditions.
