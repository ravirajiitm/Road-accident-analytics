# Road Accident Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road accidents with the goal of forecasting the best mode of transport to reduce accident numbers. The analysis is conducted using Excel, and the insights are presented through a dynamic dashboard. The data is sourced from the Transport Department of Bihar, and the project encompasses a series of steps from requirement gathering to dashboard creation.

## Project Steps

### 1. Requirement Gathering from Client

- Engaged in discussions with the client to understand the project's objectives and expectations.
- Identified key requirements related to the analysis of road accidents and forecasting the best mode of transport.

### 2. Identify the Stakeholders of the Project

- Identified and engaged with relevant stakeholders, including the Transport Department of Bihar and other entities involved in road safety.

### 3. Data Cleaning as per the Requirement

- Conducted thorough data cleaning to ensure the dataset's accuracy and reliability.
- Addressed missing or inconsistent data to enhance the quality of the analysis.

### 4. Data Processing by Adding Customized Columns

- Introduced customized columns to the dataset to facilitate specific analyses.
- Enhanced the dataset with additional parameters that were crucial for the analysis.

### 5. Data Analysis by Pivot Tables and Excel Functions

- Utilized Excel's Pivot Tables and various functions for in-depth data analysis.
- Extracted meaningful insights related to accident trends, vehicle types, and casualties.

### 6. Data Visualization

- Created charts and custom sheets to visually represent the analyzed data.
- Implemented visualization techniques to make complex data more understandable.

### 7. Report/Dashboard Creation from Start to End

- Developed a comprehensive dashboard report covering various parameters:
  - Number of casualties
  - Vehicle types
  - Month-wise accident data
  - Insights about monthly casualties by different types of vehicles
  - Fatal, slight, and serious casualties
  - Area-wise casualties
  - Casualties by dark-light conditions
  - Casualties by road surface conditions

## Analysis and Insights

The Excel file includes detailed analysis and dynamic dashboards, providing insights into the following aspects:

1. **Monthly Casualties:**
   - Breakdown of casualties on a month-to-month basis.
   - Visualization of trends over time.

2. **Casualties by Vehicle Type:**
   - Analysis of casualties based on different types of vehicles.
   - Identification of vehicles contributing most to accidents.

3. **Fatal, Slight, and Serious Casualties:**
   - Categorization and analysis of casualties by severity.
   - Understanding the impact of accidents in terms of severity.

4. **Area-wise Casualties:**
   - Geographical distribution of accidents.
   - Identification of high-risk areas.

5. **Casualties by Lighting Conditions:**
   - Analysis of accidents based on lighting conditions (daylight, dark-light).
   - Insights into how lighting conditions affect accident rates.

6. **Casualties by Road Surface:**
   - Understanding the impact of road surface on accident severity.
   - Recommendations for improving road conditions.
